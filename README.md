## Advanced Shell Scripting

### 01 Shell Script Template

__Intention:__
The template will be amended to be used as a bash shell script.
The script will be used as both a standalone script and as a function library.
The command line arguments will be parsed using both the getopts function
and the manual method.
For the purpose of this project, the configuration file will be located in this
directory as a hidden file.

The template is taken from [mt xia](http://www.mtxia.com/js/index.shtml) web site.
This project is based on the video tutorial from the same site.
